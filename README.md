# flight_comparison
This project was my mini-project 1 of the data science course at Ã…bo Akademi. 

This project will cover web scraping, the way of fetching online data from websites, essential for data scientists to get a hand on some experiments and practice their data analysis skills.

As well as the EDA on the data itself to compare the flight prices for the users.

More details can be read from report.pdf in this repository.

To run this code, you need you open the file either in Google Collab or Jupyter Server.

Or just turn it into a Python module! :)
